        our content or whose products or services we think may interest you.

        companies and business partners, and if we are involved in a merger,
        asset sale or other business reorganization, we may also share or
        transfer your personal and non-personal information to our
        successors-in-interest.
      </p>

        management, e-mail management, storage marketing, credit card
        processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for products and

        these services for us and for you.
      </p>

        We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses,
        for analytics purposes with third parties such as web analytics
        partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your IP
        address is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and
        other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have
        visited the website in a shared location, and type of the device
        used to visit the website. They may aggregate information about our

        We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you

        in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to
        respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect
        our rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of
        the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical,

        these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or
        other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email.
        We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact
        them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send
        unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you
        do. By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to
        use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like
        Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who
        have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses
        submitted only through the order processing page will be used for
        the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining
        to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us
        through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated
        in this Policy. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe
        from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe
        instructions at the bottom of each email.

        9. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide
        my.new to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy.
        This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with
        and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need
        to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to
        comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we‚Äôll either remove
        it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can&#39;t
        identify you.

      <h3 id="10-how-do-we-protect-your-information-">
        10. How Do We Protect Your Information?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety
        of your personal information when you place an order or enter,
        submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a
        secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is
        transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then
        encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be
        accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such
        systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.
        After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social
        security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We
        cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any
        information you transmit to my.new or guarantee that your
        information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered,
        or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or
        managerial safeguards.

      <h3 id="11-could-my-information-be-transferred-to-other-countries-">
        11. Could my information be transferred to other countries?
      </h3>
      <p>
        my.new is incorporated in Republic Of Korea. Information collected
        via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use
        of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our
        offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the
        world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including
        countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating
        the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by
        applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent
        to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.
      </p>
      <h3

      >
        12. Is the information collected through the my.new Service secure?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We
        have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help
        safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and
        correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security
        systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition,
        people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to
        follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to
        protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
        security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to
        protect your personal information, you agree that intentional
        misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with
        that duty.

        The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the

        Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our
        internal company employment policies.

        Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect
        on other information that we maintain, or information that we have
        provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy
        prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect
        your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as
        requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before
        granting you profile access or making corrections. You are
        responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and
        account information at all times.

      <p>
        You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to
        remove each and every record of the information you have provided to
        us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect
        information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your
        information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult

        25. Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
      </h3>
      <p>
        We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from
        the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy
        Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data
        collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being
        replicated or used in the wrong way.
      </p>
      <h4 id="what-is-gdpr-">What is GDPR?</h4>
      <p>
        GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates
        how EU residents&#39; data is protected by companies and enhances
        the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just
        the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers‚Äô data is
        important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we
        have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our
        operations worldwide.
      </p>
      <h4 id="what-is-personal-data-">What is personal data?</h4>
      <p>
        Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual.
        GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on
        its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to
        identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person‚Äôs name or
        email address. Some examples include financial information,
        political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses,
        physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.
      </p>
      <p>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and
          transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person
          would reasonably expect.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific
          purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations
          must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil
          its purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own
          personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and
          that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to
          another organization.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="why-is-gdpr-important-">Why is GDPR important?</h4>
      <p>
        GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should
        protect individuals&#39; personal data that they collect and
        process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing
        enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these
        facts it&#39;s simply the right thing to do. At Help Scout we
        strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we
        already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go
        beyond the requirements of this new regulation.

        Individual Data Subject&#39;s Rights - Data Access, Portability and
        Deletion
      </h4>
      <p>
        We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject
        rights requirements of GDPR. my.new processes or stores all personal
        data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all
        conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account
        is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with
        our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it
        longer than 60 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to
        be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve
        and remove personal data. We got you! We&#39;ve been set up as self
        service from the start and have always given you access to your data

        Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire
        liability of my.new and any of its suppliers under any provision of
        this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing
        shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you for the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
        my.new or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
        indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
        limited to, damages for loss of profits, for loss of data or other
        information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for
        loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of
        or inability to use the website, third-party software and/or
        third-party hardware used with the website, or otherwise in
        connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if my.new or
        any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and
        even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation
        of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
        exclusion may not apply to you.

        If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or
        invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to
        accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent
        possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will
        continue in full force and effect.

      <p>
        This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal
        notices published by my.new on the Services, shall constitute the
        entire agreement between you and my.new concerning the Services. If
        any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of
        competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not
        affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement,
        which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term
        of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of
        such term or any other term, and my.new&#39;s failure to assert any
        right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a
        waiver of such right or provision. YOU AND my.new AGREE THAT ANY
        CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST
        COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.
        OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

        Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to
        require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not
        effect a party&#39;s ability to exercise such right or require such
        performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a
        breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.
      </p>
      <p>
        o failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of
        either party, any right or any power under this Agreement shall
        operate as a waiver of that right or power. Nor shall any single or
        partial exercise of any right or power under this Agreement preclude
        further exercise of that or any other right granted herein. In the
        event of a conflict between this Agreement and any applicable
        purchase or other terms, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.
